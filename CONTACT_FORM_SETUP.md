# Contact Form Setup Instructions

Your contact form is currently set up but needs a backend service to actually send emails to your Gmail. Here are the best options:

## Option 1: Formspree (Recommended - Free & Easy)

1. **Sign up at [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io)**
2. **Create a new form** and get your form ID
3. **Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID`** in the Contact.tsx file with your actual form ID
4. **Verify your email** when Formspree sends you a confirmation

**Benefits:**
- Free tier: 50 submissions/month
- No backend coding required
- Spam protection included
- Email notifications to your Gmail

## Option 2: Netlify Forms (If deploying to Netlify)

1. **Add `netlify` attribute** to your form tag:
   ```html
   <form netlify onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
   ```
2. **Deploy to Netlify** - forms work automatically
3. **Check Netlify dashboard** for submissions

## Option 3: EmailJS (Client-side only)

1. **Sign up at [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com)**
2. **Install EmailJS**: `npm install emailjs-com`
3. **Configure email service** (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. **Update the form handler** to use EmailJS

## Option 4: Custom Backend (Advanced)

Create your own backend with:
- Node.js + Express + Nodemailer
- Python + Flask/Django
- PHP mail function

## Current Status

The form currently shows a demo simulation. To make it functional:

1. **Choose one of the options above**
2. **Follow the setup instructions**
3. **Test the form** to ensure emails reach your Gmail
4. **Update the form validation** as needed

## Quick Fix - Direct Email Link

For immediate functionality, users can click "Email Directly" which opens their email client with:
- Pre-filled recipient: mikaelelias100@gmail.com
- Subject line: Portfolio Contact
- Template message body

This ensures you still receive messages while setting up the form backend.
